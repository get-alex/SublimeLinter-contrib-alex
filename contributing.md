# Contributing

If you would like to contribute enhancements or fixes, please do the following:

1. Fork the plugin repository.
2. Hack on a separate topic branch created from the latest `master`.
3. Commit and push the topic branch.
4. Make a pull request.
5. Be patient.  ;-)

Please note that modifications should follow these coding guidelines:

- Indent is 4 spaces.
- Code should pass flake8 and pep257 linters.
- Vertical whitespace helps readability, don't be afraid to use it.
- Please use descriptive variable names, no abbreviations unless they are very well known.

Thank you for helping out!
